## Need Simple Column Sorting?
Recently, I have been working on data-intensive AngularJS applications where the data is often displayed in a simple grid. Most of the time, these grids are read-only and I don't need anything special....except for the ability to sort by column. __Many__ solutions exist, but I haven't found one that wasn't bloated with other grid features I didn't need. So I created a generic solution for column-based sorting. The [gist][gist] below uses a simple HTML table as an example. Comments on the gist are welcome. _Enjoy!_
