## Yesterday to Today Recap
In the [last][last] post, I talked briefly about the web in broad strokes - focusing on the fact that __content__ is king. Yet certain forces steered technology in a way that severely limited the reach and effectiveness of content. Due to market momentum, content became isolated in both architecture and representation. Eventually, technology introduced a band-aid in the form of search engines. We find ourselves in this place today - relying heavily on search technology to make effective use of our isolated content.


## Data as Revolutionary Business
In a very short amount of time, the internet highways detoured through search engine neighborhoods. The resulting high volume of traffic started to reveal incredible value as _people_ could be tracked and targeted as never before. Eventually, _content_ became a means to an end as __data__ on _people_ started to become highly valued. Identities, relationships, habits, behavior etc. This is an extremely huge topic and it birthed some of my favorite buzzwords like __big data__ and __analytics__. Rather than diverge into that mess, I'd like to suggest that this new "data on people" business has become one of the biggest drivers in the web's evolution. This new emphasis on _data_ has incidentally caused _content_ to take a back seat (momentarily). The technology ramifications are huge. Previously, technology was all about building content empires. Now, technology is all about breaking content down, dissecting it, and linking it. All for the sake of more data. In many ways, the motivations have taken a 180 in only a few short years. But that's just the beginning.

## API Economy
Data started to sell. Entire business models started to appear - all with _data_ as the _product_. As commerce started to become familiar with the business [models][bizmod], the floodgates opened for _all sorts_ of data to be exchanged. Suddenly, there were business reasons to steer _away_ from the silo model of yesterday:

* New revenue [streams][bizmod] based entirely on __data__
* Perception as an innovative, open, and collaborative organization
* Operational savings due to easier __integration__
* An environment ripe for new opportunities due to cross-pollination
* Effectively leveraging the mobile channel requires a very different architecture 

Today, APIs are a necessary consideration for anyone entering the digital marketplace in any capacity. [Advocates][apievangelist] continue to aid this by providing insights, education, research, and general API evangelism. One of the most exciting aspects of APIs is the sheer uncertainty of potential. We don't know what we don't know, but API-enabled _integrations_ can lead us into knowing what we don't know. I think that's the position that spurs the most exciting innovation.

## Back to Content
What about the king? I believe content will _remain_ king. However, I think the API economy and the dramatic push for a more distributed, modular, and decoupled architecture will bring the focus back where it belongs. We are getting smarter about how to integrate and otherwise share data and metadata. This can only improve the access to content - both old and new. I can imagine the web becoming a dichotomy. Content-based and API-based. We may see better ways to author content, but the innovation is likely to occur much faster on the data side of things. At least that seems to be what [history][semantic] tells us.

## Next Up
If given the chance, I'll continue blogging down this road with a deeper dive on the architecture side of things. As a developer, it's exciting to think ahead and solve real problems with all of these forces in mind.
