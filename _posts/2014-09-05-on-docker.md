## Look Here First
I've been collecting my thoughts for an entry on [docker][docker], but today I ran across Adrian Cockroft's [article][adrian] on the subject. He describes the phenomenon much better than I could, and I completely agree with his concise assessment.

## What About Infrastructure?
With the explosive interest in docker, I have been curious how the infrastructure component would evolve. If [CoreOS][coreos] is any indication, there doesn't seem to be much standing in the way of progress here.

### The OS Layer
Until recently, I've been stuck with too-fat linux distributions just to get basic Docker support. Core OS is an example of a dramatic move toward an entirely new architecture: multiple containers sharing a single kernel. No hypervisors. No packages with painful dependencies. Just portable and distributable containers with the ability to consolidate or cluster.

### IaaS Players
[Digital Ocean][do] (an emerging IaaS provider) recently [announced][docore] full support for CoreOS as a first-class citizen. It seems we will only see better and more widespread support from infrastructure providers - sooner rather than later!

## The PaaS Bypass
As someone who has never been satisfied with PaaS offerings, these latest developments are very exciting!
