One of my New Year's resolutions is to incorporate more testing into my work flow. It seems I have always been on a constant search to find the _right_ amount of testing. Nowadays I'm convinced that it's best to create tests _during_ development (as opposed to before or after).

Lately, a lot of my work has been done in [AngularJS][angular], so I have recently started getting more familiar with the unit test and end-to-end (e2e) testing frameworks for Angular. To aid in the motivation, I volunteered to present my findings to the Denver AngularJS [Meetup][meetup]. I created two Github repos for the example project and the presentation slides.
